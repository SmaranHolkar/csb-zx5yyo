Whether its Snapchat,\n              Tiktok or Instagram it has always been used to connect with people\n              al around the world. Using too much social media could leed to a\n              dependancy for it like alchol or drugs. This is beacuse using\n              social media triggers the release of dopamine (the chemical that\n              makes you \"feel good\") this is also known as the reward system,\n              also released when we eat. The things that trigger doppamine is\n              whenever you get a notifications, likes or messages, this makes\n              users feel good about themselves making them want to do it more to\n              satisfy themselves. It is known that it can help cope with\n              depression and lonliness\n            </ReadMoreReadLess>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"AI\">\n          <h>\n            <u>How dangerous are AI and machine learning to life?</u>\n          </h>\n          <p>\n            <ReadMoreReadLess>\n              Recent years AI has developed in alot of areas Elon Musk says they\n              are the most dangerous thing on the planet.\n            </ReadMoreReadLess>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"AI\">\n          <h>\n            <u>How dangerous are AI and machine learning to life?</u>\n          </h>\n          <p>\n            <ReadMoreReadLess>\n              Recent years AI has developed in alot of areas Elon Musk says they\n              are the most dangerous thing on the planet.\n            </ReadMoreReadLess>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import { StrictMode } from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport \"./index.css\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nReactDOM.render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>,\n  rootElement\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
